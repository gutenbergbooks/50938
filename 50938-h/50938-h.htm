<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>In offering this book to the public after having had
the manuscript actually on my desk for more than nine
years, let me say frankly that no one realizes better than
myself, now, the magnitude of the subject and the many
faults of my attempt to handle it.</p>

<p>My attention was first directed to the Sign Language
in 1882 when I went to live in Western Manitoba.
There I found it used among the various Indian tribes
as a common language, whenever they were unable
to understand each other’s speech. In later years I
found it a daily necessity when traveling among the
natives of New Mexico and Montana, and in 1897, while
living among the Crow Indians at their agency near
Fort Custer, I met White Swan, who had served under
General George A. Custer as a Scout. He had been sent
across country with a message to Major Reno, so escaped
the fatal battle; but fell in with a party of Sioux, by whom
he was severely wounded, clubbed on the head, and left
for dead. He recovered and escaped, but ever after was
deaf and practically dumb. However, sign-talk was
familiar to his people and he was at little disadvantage
in daytime. Always skilled in the gesture code, he now
became very expert; I was glad indeed to be his pupil,
and thus in 1897 began seriously to study the Sign
Language.</p>

<p>In 1900 I included a chapter on Sign Language in my
<!--page-vi-->
projected Woodcraft Dictionary, and began by collecting
all the literature. There was much more than I expected,
for almost all early travellers in our Western
Country have had something to say about this <i>lingua
franca</i> of the Plains.</p>

<p>As the material continued to accumulate, the chapter
grew into a Dictionary, and the work, of course, turned
out manifold greater than was expected. The Deaf,
our School children, and various European nations, as
well as the Indians, had large sign vocabularies needing
consideration. With all important print on the
subject I am fairly well conversant, besides which I have
had large opportunities in the field and have tried to
avail myself of them to the fullest extent, carrying my
manuscript from one Indian tribe to another, seeking
out always the best sign-talkers among them, collecting
and revising, aiming to add all the best signs in use to
those already on record.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following are the chief printed works on Sign
Language:</p>

<p><b>1823. The Indian Language of Signs</b> by Major
Stephen H. Long, published in his Expedition to the
Rocky Mts., 1823, Vol. I, pp. 378–394. Gives 104 signs.
The earliest extensive vocabulary on record.</p>

<p><b>1880. Gesture Signs and Signals of the North
American Indians</b> by Lieut. Col. Garrick Mallery. An
elaborate and valuable 330 page quarto compilation
from many contributors; published by the Bureau
of American Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution,
1880.</p>
<!--page-vii-->

<p>It was preliminary to the much more extended work
published the year following, and combines in itself
all the important vocabularies published up to that
time, including: <i>Wm. Dunbar’s List</i> pub. Trans. Am. Phil.
Soc., January 16, 1801; about 60 signs; <i>Prince Maximilian
von Wied-Neuwied’s List</i>, Reise, Nord. Am.,
1832–34, 1837; <i>Capt. R. F. Burton’s List</i> pub. in “The
City of the Saints,” 1862; <i>Dr. D. G. MacGowan’s List</i>
pub. in <i>Historical Magazine</i>, Vol. X, 1866, pp. 86–97;
also Manuscript Lists supplied by <i>Col. R. I. Dodge</i>,
<i>Dr. William H. Corbusier</i>, U. S. A., and about forty other
contributors.</p>

<p><b>1881. Sign Language Among the North American
Indians</b> compared with that among other peoples and
Deaf Mutes, by Col. Garrick Mallery; 290 page quarto,
286 illustrations, an elaborate examination of the history,
origin, and nature of the Sign Language, with extensive
vocabularies. Published in 1st Annual Report, Bureau
of American Ethnology, 1881.</p>

<p><b>1885. The Indian Sign Language</b> by Capt. William
Philo Clark, U. S. A., 244 pp. octavo, quite the best book
on the subject, giving over 1,000 signs with photographic
exactness; it is also one of the best early encyclopedic
books on Indians in general; unfortunately, it is without
illustrations and is out of print. Published by Hamersly
&amp; Co., of Philadelphia, 1885.</p>

<p>This is practically the only publication quoted in preparing
this work. I have referred to it continually as a
standard—as the highest available authority. (W. P.
Clark was born July 27, 1845, at Deer River, Lewis Co.,
New York. Graduated from West Point June 15, 1868.
Served on the Plains in 2d Cavalry during the Indian
<!--page-viii-->
wars of 1876 to 1880. Died at Washington, D. C.,
September 23, 1884.)</p>

<h3>HADLEY INDIAN SIGN PRINTS</h3>

<p>About twenty-five years ago there lived in Anadarko,
Indian Territory, an enthusiastic missionary worker
named Lewis F. Hadley, known to the Indians as Ingonompashi.</p>

<p>He made a study of Sign Language in order to furnish
the Indians with a pictographic writing, based on diagrams
of the signs, and meant to be read by all Indians,
without regard to their speech. Pointing to the Chinese
writing as a model and parallel, he made a Sign Language
font of 4,000 pictographic types for use in his projected
works. He maintained that 110,793 Indians were at
that time sign-talkers and he proposed to reach them by
Sign-Language publications.</p>

<p>In pursuance of his plan, he issued the following:</p>

<p><b>1887. List of the Primary Gestures in Indian Sign
Talk.</b> “Only 19 copies were printed.” It was intended
as a prodrome to “<i>extended works and a magazine in
Hands-tal[k]ing</i>.”</p>

<p>It consists of 63 pages with 684 crude woodblocks of
white lines on black ground, illustrating signs, alphabetically
arranged, but without captions or text of any kind,
except the explanation on the title page, abridged as above.</p>

<p><b>1890. A Lesson in Sign Talk</b>, designed to show the
use of the line showing the movement of the hands in the
Indian Gesture Language, by In-go-nom-pa-shi, Fort
Smith, Ark., 1890. Copyrighted by Lewis F. Hadley,
12 pp. A portrait of him by himself is on p. 11, inscribed
“In-go-nom-pa-shi, drawn by himself at 60 years.”</p>
<!--page-ix-->

<p>It devotes 3 pages to general discussion of Sign Talk, 1½
pages to reform of our spelling, the rest is given to general
remarks with 12 poor illustrations in white line, also a
Scripture text with 15 signs drawn, the Lord’s Prayer
with 55 drawn signs, and on p. 12, The Indian Little Star,
a novel version of “Twinkle, Twinkle,” rendered in 97
drawn signs.</p>

<p><b>1893. Indian Sign Talk.</b> Being a Book of Proofs of
the matter printed or equivalent cards designed for teaching
sign-talking Indians as much English as can be explained
through the medium of their “Universal” Gesture
Language, by Ingonompashi, copyrighted May 15,
1893, “only 75 copies are saved.”</p>

<p>This is Hadley’s most extended work. It is a dictionary
of the Sign Language, in 268 large octavo leaves
printed on one side only of each sheet.</p>

<p>It consists of 9 pages of Preface and general matter,
192 pp. of dictionary alphabetically arranged, each page
having three gestures figured and beside each the equivalent
in English. A total of 577 signs (including a double).
Pages 193 to 205 are given to small reproductions of the
sign drawings to illustrate “measurements of type”—his
font—about 800 illustrations, two pages of appendix
with compound sign words, and 14 illustrations, 1 page
of black type, 18 in number, 53 pages of reading matter
in signs, the above cited version of “Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star” and the story of “Wolf and the White Man”
in signs; the rest being Scripture texts and exhortations
and the 19th Psalm, ending with the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p>The cards referred to I have. They consist of 571 separate
cards with an illustrated sign on each and additional
matter on the back. Besides which there are
<!--page-x-->
about 100 separate cards each with a scripture text,
chapter, or sermonette on it, about 1,000 illustrations
in all. The same being the matter of the dictionary
proper reproduced on separate cards, the diagram on one
side and the text on the other. The front matter and the
type measurements do not, however, appear on the cards.
Though poor as art, the drawings are of some value to
the student.</p>

<p>This is the most ambitious work extant on the subject
of Sign Language, but seems to be quite unknown to most
ethnologists, and is not in any library, so far as I can learn,
except the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution,
the New York Public Library, the Library of
Prof. J. C. Elsom of Wisconsin State University, and my
own collection.</p>

<p>Of the 75 copies issued, only these 5 have been accounted
for, but cards comprising the dictionary part
were issued to the extent of 100,000 in sets of 571 each,
and the reading matter on cards to the number of over
27,000.</p>

<p><b>1910. The Sign Language</b>, by Prof. J. Schuyler Long,
State School for the Deaf, Council Bluffs, Iowa, published
at Washington, D. C., 1910. A valuable dictionary
of about 1,500 signs used by the deaf, with 500
admirable photographic illustrations. Of these signs a
large number seem to be arbitrary, but many are evidently
of good construction and quite acceptable to
Indian sign-talkers.</p>

<p>To these should be added:</p>

<p><b>1832. La Mimica</b>, by Andrea de Jorio. “La mimica
degli antichi investigata nel Gestire Napoletano.” Napoli,
1832, 8vo, 372 pp., 21 plates.</p>
<!--page-xi-->

<p>This interesting Italian work on Sign Language was
written to show that the gestures figured on antique vases,
etc., may be explained by their modern parallels, especially
as observed in Naples. The 21 plates illustrate
about one hundred of these gestures—about half of these
are reproduced in Mallery’s 1881 publication.</p>

<p><b>1854. Dactylologie</b> by Louis de Mas-Latrie. “Dictionnaire
de Paleographie.” <i>Tome Quarante-septième</i>,
pp. 179 to 366.</p>

<p>An extended study of Finger-talking as used by the
deaf, the savages, etc. About 30 American Indian
signs are described and compared with those of the deaf.
No illustrations.</p>

<p><b>1878. The Gesture Language</b>, by E. B. Tyler, in his
studies in “Early History of Mankind,” third edition,
1878, pp. 14–81.</p>

<p>An interesting but not very important dissertation
on the Gesture Language in use among the deaf, the
Cistercian Monks, and the American Indians. No illustrations.</p>

<p><b>1883. Sign Language, Remarks on</b>, by Wilfred
Powells in his “Wanderings in a Wild Country.” An
account of a three years’ residence in New Britain (to
the north of New Guinea), 1883, pp. 254–261, with 14
good figures, showing the digital origin of numbers.</p>

<p><b>1896. Arunta Sign Language</b>, E. C. Stirling. Rep.
Horn Scientific Exped. to Central Australia; IV, pp.
111–125.</p>

<p>A considerable discourse on the Sign Language as used
by the very primitive races. Many figures.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My thanks are due to General Hugh Lenox Scott,
<!--page-xii-->
U. S. A., one of the best living sign-talkers, for a general
review of the text, with new signs and explanations as
indicated.</p>

<p>To John Homer Seger of Colony, Oklahoma, for much
assistance. He was for 45 years in official control of the
Indians at Darlington and Colony, Oklahoma. They
were of the Southern Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Arapaho
tribes chiefly. All his communications with them were
in the Sign Language, so that he became one of our best
experts. We have corresponded much, and during a
prolonged visit to his home in August, 1915, we together
went over every sign in this Manual. His signs were of
the Cheyenne dialect.</p>

<p>To the Reverend Walter C. Roe (since dead) of Colony,
Oklahoma, for many notes and comments. He
was so expert that he preached every Sunday in the Sign
Language.</p>

<p>To Sheeaka, or Cyiaka (The Mudhen), a Yanktonnais
Sioux living at Standing Rock. He worked over my
entire manuscript with me in 1912, endorsing most of
the signs given by Clark, as well as adding those that are
accredited to him. He was considered the best sign-talker
on the reservation. His familiarity with the Sign
Language was largely due to the fact that a member of
his family was a deaf-mute, so that he has kept up the
method while others of his generation are forgetting it.
Frank Zahn, an intelligent and educated half-breed,
acted as interpreter and helped with many suggestions.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1916 I took my manuscript to Montana
and received valuable help from the following
Blackfoot Indians:</p>

<p>Bearhead, an old-time, full-blooded Piegan Indian,
<!--page-xiii-->
with a pronounced contempt for modern ways and modern
signs; George Starr or Bull Calf, a half-blood, who
acted as interpreter for Bearhead; Medicine Owl, Eagle
Child, Three Bears, Two-Guns Whitecalf; all full-blooded
Piegans and excellent sign-talkers.</p>

<p>Heavy Breast, a half-blood, acted as interpreter, with
assistance from James C. Grant.</p>

<p>I am also indebted to Chasing Bear (Ma-to Hu-wa-pi),
a Santee, and to Chief Tom Frosted, a Yanktonnais;
both of Standing Rock. About a dozen good signs were
given me by C. B. Ruggles, of Taos, New Mexico; and
helpful information was received from Thomas La Forge,
official interpreter for the Crow Nation, and Clitzo Dead-man,
an educated Navaho at Ganado, Arizona.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1917 I spent some time among the
Cheyennes at Concho, Oklahoma, checking up my lists.
My chief source of information was Robert Burns, an
intelligent and educated Cheyenne, who spoke excellent
English and was also a good sign-talker. At the same
time I got much valuable assistance from Cheyenne
Fanny (Mrs. Hamilton), Deafy Fletcher, and numerous
old Cheyennes and Arapahoes about the Post. Father
Isadore, of the St. Patrick’s Mission, Anadarko, Oklahoma,
and the Reverend Sherman Coolidge (Arapahoe),
of Sheridan, Wyoming, also contributed.</p>

<p>In the case of special or unusual signs, I give the name
of the best of my authorities; but when, according to my
own observation, the sign is in general use and indorsed
by practically all, no authority is cited.</p>

<p>I have to thank my friends James Mooney and F. W.
Hodge of the Smithsonian Institution, and Professor
J. Schuyler Long, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, for much helpful
<!--page-xiv-->
criticism; Professor Elmer D. Read, of the Pennsylvania
School for the Deaf, for a review of the Introduction;
also, Doctor Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa), Colonel
W. F. Cody (Buffalo Bill), Hamlin Garland, Miss
Frances Densmore, and Mrs. Mary Austin for contributions
or criticism.</p>

<p>For the French and German equivalent words I am
chiefly indebted to Doctor Lillian Delger Powers, of
Mt. Kisco, New York. Some assistance was given by
Miss Dorothy Dwenger, of Greenwich, Connecticut, and
Harry G. Seides, Professor of German, Jersey City High
School, New Jersey.</p>

<p>The drawings throughout are by myself.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>ITS ANTIQUITY</h3>

<p>Many thoughtful men have been trying for a century,
at least, to give mankind a world-speech which would
overstep all linguistic barriers, and one cannot help
wondering why they have overlooked the Sign Language,
the one mode common to all mankind, already established
and as old as Babel. Yes, more ancient than the hills.</p>

<p>As far back as the records go, we find the Sign Language
in use. General Hugh L. Scott has pointed out
nineteen examples in Homer. Greek vases, Japanese
bronzes, ancient Hindu statuary, as well as songs and
legends older than history, give testimony in like tenor.
While Egyptologists remind us that the oldest records
show, not only that the Sign Language was then used,
but that the one original code was much like that in use
to-day. The fact that it is yet found all over the world
wherever man is man, is proof of its being built on human
nature in the beginnings. We might even argue that it is
more ancient than speech.</p>

<p>Ideas certainly came before the words that express
them. The idea of “hunger” must be a thousand times
as old as any existing “word” for “hunger.” When it
became necessary to communicate to another the idea of
hunger, it certainly was easier and more direct to communicate
it by gesture than by word. The word had,
perforce, to be more or less arbitrary, but the gesture was
<!--page-xvi-->
logical, and could at once indicate the pain, its place, and
even hint at the cause.</p>

<p>The possible variations of a mere squeak in a concealed
pipe are obviously less in number and far less
graphic and logical than the various movements of two
active, free-moving, compound, visible parts of the body
that utilize all the dimensions of space, all the suggestions
of speed, motion, physical form and action, juxtaposition,
yes, even a measure of sound, and that could in a multitude
of cases reproduce the very idea itself.</p>

<p>Animals have far more gestures to express thoughts and
emotions than they have sounds, and children instinctively
use gestures for various ideas long before they
acquire the sound for them. In all races as a rule the
very young children’s gestures are the same, but the
different words imposed by the different mothers have
little or nothing in common, and no obvious basis in
logic. All of which goes to prove the greater antiquity of
eye-talk over ear-talk. To which conclusion we are
forced also by the superiority of sight over hearing as a
sense. “Seeing is believing,” is convincement: hearing
is more open to challenge.</p>

<p>Nor can the sign-talk have changed radically, for it is
founded on the basic elements of human make-up, and on
mathematics, and is so perfectly ideographic that no
amount of bad presentation can completely divert attention
from the essential thought to the vehicle; while
punning is an impossibility.</p>

<p>It had all the inherent possibilities of speech, was indeed
capable of even greater subtleties, as we have noted,
and had a far greater distance range, three or four times
that of spoken words.</p>
<!--page-xvii-->

<p>In view of the greater antiquity and many advantages
that hand gestures have over spoken language, one is
prompted to ask: Why did it not develop and continue
man’s chief mode of inter-communication? The answer
is, doubtless, partly because it was useless in the dark or
when the person was out of sight or partly hidden by
intervening things. Diagrammatically expressed it was
thus:</p>

<div class="illustration">
    <img src="images/page-xvii.jpg" width="500" height="220" alt="Speech and Gesture" />
</div>

<p>Speech therefore covers all directions night and day.</p>

<p>Gesture covers one-third of the circle in hours of light.</p>

<p>Therefore speech serves six times as many occasions as
gesture.</p>

<p>But the chief reason for the triumph of the appeal to
the ear is doubtless because the hands were in constant
use for other things; the tongue was not; was indeed practically
free to specialize for this end.</p>

<h3>ITS UNIVERSALITY</h3>

<p>Being so fundamental, ancient, and persistent, Sign
Language is, <i>perforce</i>, universal. In some measure it is
used by every race on earth to-day. Eskimo and Zulu,
Japanese and Frenchman, Turk and Aztec, Greek and
Patagonian. And whenever two men of hopelessly diverse
<!--page-xviii-->
speech have met, they have found a medium of
thought exchange in the old Sign Language—the pantomimic
suggestion of ideas.</p>

<p>Latin races are proverbially hand-talkers, so that the
Sign Language is more widely used among them than
with Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<p>But the American Plains Indian is undoubtedly the
best sign-talker the world knows to-day. There are, or
were, some thirty different tribes with a peculiar speech
of their own, and each of these communicated with the
others by use of the simple and convenient sign-talk of the
plains. It is, or was, the language of Western trade and
diplomacy as far back as the records go. Every traveller
who visited the Buffalo Plains had need to study and
practise this Western Volapuk, and all attest its simplicity,
its picturesqueness, its grace, and its practical utility.</p>

<p>Many of the best observers among these have left us
long lists of signs in use, Alexander Henry in his gossipy
journal among the Mandans of the Missouri in 1806 tells
us of the surprise and interest he felt in watching two
Indian chiefs of different tribes who conversed freely for
hours on all subjects of common interest, conveying their
ideas accurately by nothing but simple gestures.</p>

<p>The European races are much less gifted as sign-talkers.
But we all have a measure of it that is a surprise
to most persons when first confronted with the facts.
Our school children especially make daily use of the
ancient signals.</p>

<h3>AMONG SCHOOL CHILDREN</h3>

<p>In taking observations among school-boys and girls, I
had this uniform experience: All denied any knowledge
<!--page-xix-->
of the Sign Language, <i>at first</i>, but were themselves surprised
on discovering how much of it they had in established
use.</p>

<p>One very shy little girl—so shy that she dared not
speak—furnished a good illustration:</p>

<p>“Do you use the Sign Language in your school?” I
asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Do you learn any language but English?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“What is the use of learning any other than English?”</p>

<p>She raised her right shoulder in the faintest possible
shrug and at the same time turned her right palm slightly
up.</p>

<p>“Now,” was my reply, “don’t you see you have answered
all my three questions in signs which you said you
did not use?”</p>

<p>Following the subject, I said: “What does this mean?”
and held up my right hand with the first and second
fingers crossed.</p>

<p>“Pax,” she whispered; and then, after further trials, I
learned that at least thirty signs were in daily use in that
local school.</p>

<p>This was in England. In America the sign “Pax,” or
“King’s cross,” is called “King’s X,” “Fines” or “Fins”
or “Fends,” “Bars up” or “Truce,” meaning always,
“I claim immunity.”</p>

<p>This is a very ancient sign and seems to refer to the
right of sanctuary. The name “King’s cross,” used
occasionally in England, means probably the sanctuary in
the King’s palace.</p>

<p>In general I found about 150 gesture signals in
<!--page-xx-->
established use among American school children,
namely:</p>

</ul>

<p>In all, 110; besides the compass points, the features of
the face, the parts of the body, the numerals up to 20 or
30, and a great many half-established signs, such as
<!--page-xxv-->
book, telephone, ring the bell, etc., which, if allowed,
would bring the number up to nearly 200.</p>

<p>As another line of observation, I have asked New
York boys, “How many signs does the Broadway policeman
use in regulating the traffic?” Any bright child
remembers presently that the officer seldom speaks,
could scarcely be heard if he did. Indeed, he relies
chiefly on Sign Language and hourly uses the established
signs for “Stop,” “Come on,” “Come here,” “Go right,”
“Go left,” “Go back,” “Hurry up,” “Go easy,” “I warn
you,” “I’ll punish you,” “Pass,” “Keep behind me,”
“Scorn,” and, perhaps, one or two others.</p>

<p>While not infrequently the small boy responds with
the sign of “insolent defiance” that is used the world
’round, and was probably invented by Cain and Abel.</p>

<p>Similarly, the car conductor uses the signs for “Do
you want this car?” “Do you want transfer?” “How
many?” “Go on,” as well as most of the above.</p>

<p>Evidently, then, the Sign Language is used of necessity
in much of our life where speech is impossible.</p>

<h3>CODES, ETC.</h3>

<p>It is inevitable that a world-wide language be split
into variant forms. Besides the fragmentary Sign Code
among our children, the more copious list of signs among
Latins, and the code of the Cistercian or Trappist Monks,
there are the Deaf Code and the Sign Language of the
American Indians. Only the two last are widely established
and at all complete as languages to-day.</p>

<h3>DEAF CODE</h3>

<p>The Sign Language used by the deaf was originated
in France by Abbé de l’Epée about 1759, with a view to
<!--page-xxvi-->
facilitating the intercommunication of the deaf. His
signs were largely arbitrary or founded on the spelling
of French words, usually in abbreviated form, so that it
was merely a short-hand of French done into finger-spelling.</p>

<p>While this was the case at its beginning, the deaf
themselves had instinctively done so much in the way
of introducing pantomime and expressive gesture, that
they have half redeemed the Code from its unfortunate
original plan, and, in so doing, have made themselves intelligible
to an immensely larger audience.</p>

<h3>THE INDIAN CODE</h3>

<p>So far as I can learn, no student hitherto has compared
the various methods without being convinced that
the American Indian Sign Language is the best extant.
It is theoretically perfect and practically complete. In
order to make this evident, I must offer a definition and
some comparative details.</p>

<p><i>A true Sign Language is an established code of logical
gestures to convey ideas; and is designed as an appeal to
the eye, without the assistance of sounds, grimaces, apparatus,
personal contact, written or spoken language, or
reference to words or letters; preferably made by using only
the hands and adjoining parts of the body.</i></p>

<p>Measured by these standards, there is only one true
Gesture Language in the field to-day; that is the sign-talk
of the American Indians. It is established over
the whole area of the Great Plains; and, though varied
locally, is essentially the same from Saskatchewan to
Rio Grande.</p>

<p>In general, it is claimed that there are two well-marked
<!--page-xxvii-->
dialects of this: the northern, which is a <i>whole hand</i> and a
<i>two-hand</i> dialect; the central and southern, which is a
<i>finger</i> and <i>one-hand</i> dialect.</p>

<p>The former is better for far signalling; the latter
for conversation. There are, however, many exceptions
to these rules; and, in any case, they are so
close akin that Indians from opposite extremes of
the Plains have no difficulty in conversing with each
other.</p>

<p>The Cheyennes originally lived in a central region
where they had intercourse with a dozen tribes whose
spoken language differed from their own; so they became
very expert sign-talkers, perhaps the best. They
have amplified to the number of several thousand signs,
and simplified until theirs has become largely a one-hand
code; therefore, as far as possible, I make the Cheyenne
sign-talk my standard. All signs herein given I have
found in use among the southern Cheyennes and are
understood to be Cheyenne except when another source
is specifically mentioned.</p>

<p>Clark gives first place among gesture talkers to the
Cheyennes and their associates the Arapahoes, whose
sign-talk was the same, though their speech was very
different, so that the signs for which he is authority may
also be considered Cheyenne.</p>

<p>The signs given me as Indian by Sheeaka and his
friend, Tom Frosted, should be cautiously received if
one would study the ancient code. Sheeaka had in his
family a deaf-mute, who probably imported some signs
from the Deaf Code, as indicated.</p>

<p>In cases where there were different signs for the same
idea, I have selected the simplest and clearest, the least
<!--page-xxviii-->
like other signs; or, other things equal, the one most extensively
used, preferring a one-hand to a two-hand sign.</p>

<p>Usually that sign is best from the locality where the
idea is most familiar. Thus the Sioux sign for “tree
squirrel” is poor; the Modoc sign is very good. The
Navaho signs for “domestic sheep” are numerous and
clearly differentiated; those of the north are not, and
refer back to the “bighorn.” Southern signs for “snow”
are descriptive and cumbrous, while those of the northern
tribes are simple and perfect.</p>

<h3>A COMPARISON OF THE TWO CODES</h3>

<p>A comparison of the Deaf and Indian Codes seems to
emphasize the superiority of the Indian. The Deaf
was intended to convey, word by word, a vocal language;
it assumes that you know the other man’s speech, and can
spell. Whereas, the Indian was invented to over-ride
linguistic barriers and, knowing nothing of spelling,
deals only with ideas.</p>

<p>The next great advantage of Indian style is its picturesqueness.
The two systems can be illustrated and
fairly compared by the signs for the months.</p>

<p>First the Deaf:</p>

<p>January—Sign for <i>Month</i>, then <i>J</i>, <i>N</i>, and <i>R</i>, that is
4 signs.</p>

<p>June—Sign for <i>Month</i>, then <i>J</i> and <i>N</i>, that is 3 signs.</p>

<p>July—Sign for <i>Month</i>, then <i>J</i> and <i>L</i>, again 3 signs.</p>

<p>Whereas the Indian calls January the <i>Snow Moon</i>,
thus <i>moon</i> or “Horns in the sky” and <i>snow</i>, that is two
signs. June is <i>Rose Moon</i> i.e., <i>horns</i> or <i>Crescent in the
sky</i> and <i>rose</i> (the right hand plucking an imaginary
petal from each finger tip of the left). July is the
<!--page-xxix-->
<i>Thunder Moon</i>, i.e., <i>horns in the sky</i>, then the right index
darted downward in a quick zigzag to imitate <i>lightning</i>.
All need but two signs each.</p>

<p>The first involving a certain amount of spelling is
limited to those who can read, and who use that word.
The second, touching nothing but the idea, is widely acceptable,
much shorter, and visible much farther off. It
was apparently developed for the safe distance beyond
arrow range.</p>

<p>Again the Indian method is strong in its dignity.
The deaf often spoil their sign-talk by grimacing, the
Indian never does so. One may occasionally help the
idea by facial expression, but it should be used with
great reserve, as there is nothing more unlovely or likely
to harm the study of the Sign Language than the excessive
grimacing that one sometimes sees in an uneducated
deaf-mute. The Indian sign-talker’s face is calm and
little changed, his head is moved in graceful sweeps,
and never jerked unless to express some jerky action.
His communication is indeed a study in beautiful, dignified
gesture. There is not an Indian sign in this book
that depends on facial expression for its usefulness, and
there are but few that involve the face in any way.</p>

<p>Last year (1910) my friend Hamlin Garland met a
party of moving picture men returning from a business
tour among the Indians. He asked, “Did you get two
old chiefs talking together in the Sign Language?” They
said “No, hadn’t heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Then,” he replied, “you have missed one of the most
graceful and rewarding chances for your special art
that the western country affords.”</p>

<p>They were so much impressed with his description
<!--page-xxx-->
that they went back. Having brought together two
chiefs of diverse speech they got results on their films
which amply justified their time and trouble.</p>

<p>Finally a large number of the signs used by the deaf
are conventional and arbitrarily fixed, dating back about
100 years, whereas each Indian sign is the slow evolutionary
product of ages, with its roots deep in human
nature. It is never arbitrary, but so logical and so
reasonable that it is easily and quickly learned.</p>

<p>Every interested person, therefore, must regret profoundly
that the teachers of the deaf should have gone
out of their way to fabricate an unnatural, localized code,
when there was awaiting them ready-made, and already
established, a system founded on universal human nature,
old as the hills, full of the charms of grace and
poetry, and so logical that any one of any race can learn
it in a tithe of the time required for the acquisition of the
merest smattering of a spoken language, and the adoption
of which would at once have greatly lessened the handicap
of the deaf. One can only suppose that the founders
of the code were unaware of the other’s existence.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly actual service has done much to reform
and redeem the Deaf Code and make it more nearly
a true Sign Language, but one cannot help wishing that
their teachers would take the inevitable step at once and
adopt the natural system.</p>

<p>Thus we have logic with us as well as the opinion of
ethnologic students in giving preference to the Indian
System. While in the extent of usage honors are about
even, I am credibly assured that about 100,000 people
are daily using the Deaf Code and an equal number
using the Indian.</p>
<!--page-xxxi-->

<p>It is my belief that an available popular Manual will
soon establish the latter as the universal code and result
in its further and full development.</p>

<h3>ATTITUDE TOWARD THE SIGN LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>There are two distinct attitudes toward Indian Sign
Language:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, that of the student who sees in it a beautiful
product of evolution, a perfect demonstration of the subtle
laws of speech growth, the outcome of human mind
yearning for converse with human mind, rebellious at
its shut-in loneliness, battering with its hands the prison
walls, till it could reach out and signal to the next locked-in,
before it had yet found the way of modulated sounds.
This, then, was the means which responded to the demand
for communion and mental fellowship before there was a
spoken speech. It began, as all codes must, with the
broadest, simplest root ideas, and expressed their inter-relationships
at most by context, sequence, proximity, or
emphasis, but not by inflection.</p>

<p>Every student of the Sign Language is impressed by
this thought and very naturally considers every true
sign of the old Sign Language a thing sacred, precious
as a pre-Homeric manuscript. He believes that to modify
it or tamper with it would be to rob it of all value as a
living expression of growth, and much like trying to readjust
the crystalline forms on a frost-covered pane by
shaping them with a hot iron. The student recognizes
it as his first and highest duty to make faithful, unadulterated,
untooled records of the oldest types of signs.
This is the academic attitude. I am fully in sympathy
with it.</p>
<!--page-xxxii-->

<p><i>Second</i>, the practical attitude which realizes that Sign
Language, never dead, is coming to its renaissance and can
serve many useful ends among us here to-day. But to
complete its possibilities it must be brought up to date
by the addition of elements that stand for the latest
modern ideas; and therefore does not hesitate to seize
on and adopt these elements wherever they may be
found. Thus, it may be held, is a contamination of the
thought by interminglement of spurious recent creations.
But it is merely submitting the code to the ordinary
rules of all language. We should remember, further,
that the ancient signs, as well as the modern, were
<i>invented by men who had need of them</i>. The only difference
is that the one was invented recently, the other
maybe thousands of years ago; and that without such
changes the Sign Language could not serve its beneficent
purpose to-day among the deaf, the distant, the roar-environed,
the moving picture folk, and those of unknown
speech about us. Hand-talk fully developed will find much
good work to do; and it matters little where the elements
of the code were gathered so long as they meet with
general acceptation; which implies that they be <i>needed</i>,
<i>serviceable</i>, and of <i>sound construction</i>. The forty odd
Deaf Signs included here have been admitted on this basis.</p>

<h3>PROPER NAMES</h3>

<p>There is at least one place where all pure Sign Language
must fail; that is in dealing with proper names, especially
new proper names. If I wish to signal “New
York State” to an expert sign-talker, I can use the
nickname “Empire State” and signal “<i>Country great
crowned</i>”; or, for “Kentucky” I can signal “<i>Country
<!--page-xxxiii-->
blue grass</i>”; or Boston, “<i>The Hub City</i>”; or Chicago
“<i>Windy City</i>”; but when I come to South America or
Oberammergau or Poughkeepsie, I am obliged to fall
back on the white man’s method and spell the name.
For this reason then we begin our sign-talk by teaching
the one-handed sign alphabet of the deaf. The two-handed
will answer, but obviously a one-handed sign is
better than a two-handed, other things equal. We aim
at simplicity; and there are many occasions when one
has but one hand free.</p>

<h3>TO WHAT PURPOSE?</h3>

<p>My own interest in the study had been growing for
thirty years, and to satisfy myself that it was not a mere
fad of slight and passing import, I set down carefully
the reasons for studying and using the Sign Language,
not forgetting its limitations. I set these also in hostile
array and will give them first:</p>

<p>It is useless in the dark.</p>

<p>It cannot serve over the telephone.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be written, except by cumbrous pictographs.</p>

<p>It cannot give new proper names; they must be spelled.</p>

<p>But the reasons for the study were more numerous
and stronger.</p>

<p>1st. <i>It develops observation and accurate thinking.</i>
All races that excel in sign-talking are noted for
their keenness of observation. Which is cause and
which effect one cannot certainly determine, but it is
sure that this method of communication is excellent
practice to develop observation, and it makes for a
wonderfully graphic descriptive power.</p>
<!--page-xxxiv-->

<p>Herein, perhaps, is its most enduring, the least obvious,
claim to a high place. There is a sweet reasonableness,
a mathematical accuracy, in the fabric of the
Sign Language that has an insistent and reactionary
effect on the mental processes and pictures of those who
use it. Therefore, it is valuable for the kind of mind
it makes.</p>

<p>2d. <i>It is easily learned.</i> Unlike most languages,
it is very easily acquired, for most of the signs are natural
in concept, and so logical that they explain themselves
where their history is known. Six hundred
signs (that is ideas) make a fairly good sign-talker.</p>

<p>3d. <i>It is Indian talk.</i> By means of this you can
talk to any Plains Indian no matter what his speech;
and there are many tribes each with its own tongue or
dialect. In some measure it is understood and used by
savages and keen observers all over the globe.</p>

<p>4th. <i>A cognate code is the talk of the deaf</i>; and is
used the world round by them in preference to the
manual alphabet when possible; so that a wide use of the
much better Indian Sign Language will certainly result
in their accepting it and thus tend to lessen the barrier
between the deaf and their more fortunate brethren.</p>

<p>5th. <i>It is silent talk.</i> It can be used on occasions
when it is necessary to give information, but improper
or impossible to speak aloud. Thus, lecturers use it in
directing their lanternist; friends use it for necessary
information during musical performances; it is used at
the bedside of the sick, the actors in a moving picture
can utilize it, and so be comprehended the world round;
the pantomime stage, forbidden to use speech, can easily
make clear the plot by sign-talk.</p>
<!--page-xxxv-->

<p>In a recent letter, Prof. J. S. Long has furnished
me with a touching instance (one that has since recurred)
that indicates another and final service that the
silent method can render: An eminent divine was on
his deathbed. His life had been devoted to ministering
to the deaf, he knew the Sign Language perfectly; for
several hours before the end his power of ordinary speech
had deserted him, but his mind was clear, and to the
last he conversed freely with those about him, in this,
the universal talk, the one which for its exercise depended
on muscular powers that in his case were the last of all
to fail.</p>

<p>6th. <i>It allows talk in an uproar.</i> It can be used
when great noise makes it impossible to use the voice;
therefore it can be of daily service in modern life, city
or country, and each year it discovers new uses. Friends
talk across a rackety thoroughfare or from a moving
train; firemen and policemen, or sailors in a storm find it
of growing service. The baseball umpire uses it when
the roar of the multitude makes him voiceless; the
catcher talks to the pitcher; the aeroplanist talks to his
friends on earth; the stockholder on the curb buys and
sells in it; the football captain or the army officer issues
clear sign orders when the uproar of fight would drown
even the trumpet call. The politician facing a shrieking
mob may find it useful for conveying a few crude
truths to his crude, unruly audience, thus opening the
way for a more usual form of harangue, or failing in the
attempt, he can at least inform his friends of his next
move and his audience what he thinks of them. In
St. Paul’s epoch-making address on the stairs of Jerusalem
we have a good illustration of the first part of this.</p>
<!--page-xxxvi-->

<p>7th. <i>It is practical far-talk.</i> It is a valuable method
of talking at a distance, far beyond earshot. Compared
with the other modes of far-signalling it has the great
advantages of speed, for it gives a sentence while semaphore,
Morse, or Myer code give a letter, and of inconspicuousness
at short range, or in a crowd; also it is independent
of apparatus.</p>

<p>8th. <i>It is a true universal language.</i> It is already
established. Instinctively the whole world has adopted
it in a measure; and daily proofs of this are seen. Rasmussen
among the Eskimo would have been helpless, he
tells us, for he knew not their tongue, and they not a word
of his, but they were expert sign-talkers and the lingual
barrier was swept away. So also Henry among the Mandans,
and Butler among the Basutos, while a thousand
other cases could be aligned.</p>

<p>It is so complete that Dr. W. C. Roe and many others
regularly <i>preach</i> and <i>lecture</i> in the language of Signs, to
congregations in which several spoken tongues are used
and would be necessary to the preacher were he limited
to sounds.</p>

<p>It is so fundamental indeed that it is the easiest means
of communicating with animals; the best trainers of
dogs and horses use Sign Language as the principal
medium of command.</p>

<p>But, for lack of standards and codification, its use is
much smaller than it might be; and yet larger than commonly
supposed. At least 100 of the 725 signs herein
given are in daily employ among hearing white folk in
America. After a little extension of the study, as is
inevitable with a standard code, one will be able to travel
all over Europe, the world indeed, on Sign Language alone.
<!--page-xxxvii-->
No matter what the other man’s language may be, French,
German, Russian, Greek, all are the same in the Sign
Language because it expresses <i>ideas, not words</i>. This, then,
is its chief obvious strength—<i>It is a universal language.</i></p>

<p>It was with this in view that the French and German
equivalents were added after each sign; and since it is
impossible to render in one word a sign that stands for a
broad idea and is capable of conveying many meanings,
according to the context and sense, the foreign equivalents
are understood to deal only with the simplest root
idea, that which usually is expressed by the first of the
English words given.</p>

<p>It is my earnest hope that we may have an International
Society of the Sign Language whose functions
would be to keep it pure, to add new signs as they are
needed, and to aim at its complete development.</p>

<p>Also, that in furtherance of this a thorough, full, and
careful record of the old Indian Sign Language will be
made before it is too late; that is, before all the old-time
Indians of the Plains are dead.</p>

<p>My own effort is meant not as a record of the past,
but a starting point for the future.</p>

<h3>SYNTAX OF THE SIGN LANGUAGE<a id="marker-2" class="marker" href="#footnote-2" title="Footnote 2"><sup>2</sup></a></h3>

<p>The Sign Language is a system of root <i>ideas</i> expressed
by <i>gestures</i>, preferably made only by the hands, without
<!--page-xxxviii-->
sounds or reference to letters, or words, spoken or
written, and not delimited by anything corresponding to
words. There can be but little doubt that Sign Language
preceded all audible speech.</p>

<p>Being fundamentally a true spontaneous language,
wholly removed from any spoken language, it must necessarily
have its own syntax and idiom.</p>

<p>Its syntax is simple and primitive, much like that of
spoken language in its earliest or monosyllabic stage, as
defined by Hovelacque. Yet clearly many signs are
amplified by an associated but subsidiary root, so that we
may consider it entering the second or agglutinative stage.
Thus <i>deer</i>, signed by holding up the hands to indicate
<i>branching horns</i>, is a simple or isolated root; but <i>white-tailed
deer</i> which gives first <i>deer</i>, then adds the qualifying
sign <i>banner tail</i> by waving the right index up high,
is in close correspondence with agglutinative language.
Still more so are the signs <i>finished</i> or <i>done</i> added to
a verb to show the past tense, or the different twists
to the sign <i>give</i> that turns it respectively into <i>give
me</i> or <i>give you</i>, or the variations of <i>talk</i> which make
it mean <i>I talk to you</i>, <i>you talk to me</i>, or <i>they talk to
each other</i>.</p>

<p>The sentence construction is elemental. Dependent
sentences are not used nor are negative or involved
questions.</p>

<p>The relation of one idea to another is indicated
chiefly by proximity and sequence, rarely by connectives
and (with a few exceptions) never by inflection.
So that the same sign may be the equivalent
of a noun, a verb, or a phrase, etc., according as it is
used.</p>
<!--page-xxxix-->

<h3>NOUNS AND PRONOUNS</h3>

<p>The <b>Nominative</b> and <b>Objective cases</b> are not distinguished
except by context and sequence, that is, the Nominative
precedes, the Objective usually follows, the verb.</p>

<p>A partial exception is the first personal pronoun—the
starting point of most inflection—for <i>I</i>, <i>mine</i>, and <i>me</i> are
sometimes given as cognate but distinctive signs.</p>

<p>The <b>Possessive case</b> is usually shown by the addition
of the possessive sign, equivalent to “his,” “hers,” “its,”
etc. “That man’s” horse would be signed: <i>Man</i>, <i>that</i>,
<i>his horse</i>, or <i>Man</i>, <i>that there</i>, <i>possession</i>, <i>horse</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Gender</b> of nouns is indicated when necessary by
adding the signs <i>male</i> or <i>man</i> and <i>female</i> or <i>woman</i>.
Thus “A She bear” would be rendered <i>Bear Woman</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Number</b> of nouns is indicated by the signs 1, 2, 3,
4, etc., <i>many</i> or <i>few</i>.</p>

<p>In the Personal Pronouns the plural is made by adding
<i>all</i> to the singular. Thus <i>Me all</i> is the equivalent of
“We,” <i>You all</i> of “Ye.” <i>He all</i> is the equivalent of
“they.”</p>

<p>The <b>Person</b> by pointing to <i>myself</i>, to <i>you</i>, or to the <i>third
person</i>. The first person is understood unless otherwise
indicated.</p>

<h3>VERBS</h3>

<p>The <b>Verb</b> is usually placed between the subject and the
object, but need of emphasis may change this so the verb
comes last.</p>

<p>The <b>Tense</b> of verbs is marked by the auxiliary prefixes
<i>now</i>, <i>future</i> and <i>past</i>, <i>finished</i> or <i>done</i>. Thus “I have
eaten” would be <i>I done eat</i>, “I shall eat” will be <i>I time
ahead, eat</i>.</p>
<!--page-xl-->

<p>The present is understood, unless otherwise stated;
but the sign is plastic and may be any part of the verb,
according to context. Thus <i>Arrange</i>, <i>Arranged</i>, or
<i>Arranging</i> are the same.</p>

<p>The <b>Number</b> of the verb is shown by the context.</p>

<p>The <b>Voice</b> is assumed to be active, indeed the passive is
not used.</p>

<p>The <b>Imperative</b> is shown by following the verb with the
sign <i>must</i>, that is, strike down with right fist, giving the
significance of command, or else by emphasis.</p>

<p>The <b>Subjunctive</b> is shown by the signs <i>if</i>, <i>so that</i>, <i>perhaps</i>.</p>

<h3>ADJECTIVE AND ADVERB</h3>

<p>The <b>Adjective</b> usually follows the substantive. Thus
“A bad man” would be rendered <i>Man bad</i>. But numerals
are exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p>The <b>Adverb</b> of time precedes the verb.</p>

<p>Qualities are compared by the use of the signs <i>little</i>,
<i>more</i>, <i>much</i>, <i>most</i>, <i>ahead</i>, and <i>behind</i>. They are further
modified by adding such signs as <i>strong</i>, <i>brave</i>, <i>very
much</i>, or <i>very strong</i>.</p>

<p>The <b>Numeral sign</b> is often prefaced to small numbers
to prevent confusion. Thus when prefaced by the
numeral sign the sign <i>Wolf</i> may become <i>two</i> and <i>Man</i> become
<i>one</i>.</p>

<p>Mere particles and expletives, as “a” “the,” etc., have
no equivalent signs.</p>

<h3>PREPOSITIONS</h3>

<p>Prepositions were little used by the Indian sign-talkers,
though they did have <i>above</i>, <i>about</i>, <i>across</i>, <i>around</i>, <i>at</i>,
<i>below</i>, <i>beside</i>, <i>beyond</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>near</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>out</i>, <i>to</i>,
<!--page-xli-->
<i>under</i>, <i>upon</i>, <i>with</i>, etc. <i>Of</i> or <i>pertaining to</i> has been
added by the deaf.</p>

<h3>CONJUNCTIONS</h3>

<p><i>And</i> or <i>also</i> (add on) <i>but</i> or <i>if</i> (<i>pick out</i> or <i>cut off</i>), <i>so
that</i>, <i>with</i> are the equivalents of conjunctions. Sometimes
the close continuity of two signs serves the purpose of
“and,” conversely a pause may indicate a full stop.</p>

<h3>INTERROGATION</h3>

<p>The sign of interrogation always precedes the question,
but is sometimes added after it as well, for emphasis or
certainty.</p>

<h3>PERIOD OR FULL STOP</h3>

<p>For period, the sign <i>finished</i> is generally used. The
Blackfeet make the sign <i>broken off</i> and often clap the flat
right down on the flat left, palm to palm, for both beginning
and end of a sentence.</p>

<h3>ABSTRACT IDEAS</h3>

<p>Abstract ideas are not copiously rendered in signs.
But it often happens that a gesture with the index alone
is specific, while the same gesture with the flat hand becomes
abstract. For example, compare <i>yonder</i> and <i>far</i>,
<i>up</i> and <i>up there</i>.</p>

<h3>OPPOSITION</h3>

<p>The principle of opposition as pointed out by Mallery
plays an important part in the pairing of signs. Thus
<i>above</i> being fixed, <i>below</i> is the reverse; the sign <i>come</i>
is reversed in <i>go</i>, and <i>out</i> reversed in <i>in</i>, etc.</p>
<!--page-xlii-->

<h3>EMPHASIS</h3>

<p>Emphasis is sometimes given by using both hands for a
sign that can be made by one, sometimes by repeating the
sign, sometimes by energetic rendering, and sometimes by
adding the sign <i>very much</i> or <i>heap</i>.</p>

<h3>PARALLEL OR DUPLICATE SIGNS</h3>

<p>Many signs are made by parallel action of both hands.
Most of these are permissibly rendered by using only one
hand as, <i>woman</i>, <i>abandon</i>, <i>gratitude</i>, etc.</p>

<h3>ENUNCIATION OR DELIVERY</h3>

<p>In actual and expert practice most signs are abbreviated.
But the beginner, as in all new arts, should go
slowly and be careful to make each sign clear-cut and
complete in itself.</p>

<p>The hands are always held or moved so as to illustrate,<!--TN: changed hyphen to comma-->
as far as possible, the action in mind or its manner, or its
direction, or the point where it takes place, or the shape of
an object, or their relative positions if two objects are
being considered.</p>

<h3>ELEGANCE</h3>

<p>Grace and dignity are of large importance in all good
sign-talk. Ugly or vulgar gestures should be abandoned.
Even angular gestures should be avoided, except to express
some angular idea.</p>

<p>Many times my Indian teachers have said to me as I
imitated their signs, “Yes, that is correct enough in a
way, but it is awkward”; or “it is not graceful. We do
it this way.” Then they sketched the same structure,
<!--page-xliii-->
but in sweeping lines. In this work many movements
are indicated in straight lines, for the sake of simplicity.
As a matter of fact, I never saw a Cheyenne make a
straight-line movement, all had a graceful curve.</p>

<p>Many signs are followed by a changeable <i>liaison</i>; that
is, by an introduced sweep to join it on to the sign that
follows and avoid a jerk or unpleasant movement. This
elegant manner is what I call an Indian accent, few whites
achieve it.</p>

<p>In a dignified way, the expression of face and the pose
were used in elucidation of the gesture, but very sparingly.</p>

<h3>THE CONCEPT AND ITS VALUE</h3>

<p>The student of vocal language finds vital help in
remembering the derivation of words; so also the sign-talker.</p>

<p>Most signs were pantomimic originally, but through
much use have become shortened, till now they are conventional.
Yet it is well worth while in each case to note
the original concept as fully as possible; first as a great
help to the memory, and second as a guard against
slovenly gesture and a guarantee of point, power, and
structural accuracy. Some of the concepts given are
evidently right, but some are mere guesses, probably
wrong in many cases. It is quite permissible in any
one to challenge any of them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the fact that most signs are capable of
logical explanation does not mean that they are self-explanatory.
Indeed nearly all have become conventional,
and each must be learned separately before it can
be rightly used.</p>

<p>Signs which make the heart the seat of the mind are,
<!--page-xliv-->
I think, older than those which give the place of honor
to the brain.</p>

<h3>THE MANUAL ALPHABET</h3>

<p>Although not at all Indian, it is exceedingly helpful to
know the single-hand alphabet as given in the cut on
<a href="#page-li-illus">page li</a><!--TN: was "II"-->; partly because it must sometimes be used for
<i>giving proper names</i> and also because it saves time in
describing <i>hand positions</i>. For example, we say “position
A or B” instead of describing each hand all over
again for each new sign.</p>

<h3>THE NUMERALS</h3>

<p><i>Fingers</i> and <i>numbers</i> are nearly synonymous the world
round when making signs, manual or written, hence the
universality of the decimal system. The Indian Code,
the Popular Code, and the Deaf Code are nearly alike in
this, but in most points of difference the Indian is best.</p>

<p>To prevent mistakes in certain cases preface the number
with the sign of <i>numbers</i> or <i>arithmetic</i>.</p>

<h3>THE ORDINALS</h3>

<p>For Ordinals, make the figure sign, 1, 2, or whatever it
is, then without changing the position of hand or arm,
give the hand a twisting from the wrist, to add point or
emphasis, meaning “number-so-and-so.” This is not
Indian but adopted from the Deaf, nevertheless quite
logical.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF SIGN LANGUAGE</h3>

<p>Clark gives the following (pp. 17–18) as a good illustration
of the syntax of the Sign Language:</p>

<p><i>In English.</i> “I arrived here to-day to make a treaty—my
one hundred lodges are camped beyond the Black
<!--page-xlv-->
Hills, near the Yellowstone River. You are a great
chief—pity me, I am poor, my five children are sick and
have nothing to eat. The snow is deep and the weather
intensely cold. Perhaps God sees me. I am going. In
one month I shall reach my camp.”</p>

<p><i>In Signs</i>, this literally translated would read, I—arrive
here—to-day—to make—treaty. My—hundred—lodge—camp—beyond—Hills—Black—near—river—called—Elk—you—chief—great—pity
me—I—poor—My—five—child—sick—food—all
gone (or wiped out)—Snow—deep—cold—brave
(or strong). Perhaps—Chief
Great (or Great Mystery)—above—see—me—I—go.
Moon—die—I—arrive there—my—camp.</p>

<p>“An Indian in closing or terminating a talk or speech
wishing to say, ‘I have finished my speech or conversation,’
or, ‘I have nothing more to say,’<!--TN: added closing quote--> simply makes the
sign for ‘<i>Done</i>’ or ‘<i>Finished</i>.’”</p>

<h3>THE LORD’S PRAYER</h3>

<h4>FATHER ISADORE’S VERSION</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Our Father up high, medicine thy name. Thy sit-aboard
down here on earth as up high. Give us all
bread. Forgive our bad as we forgive bad. Lead us
bad not. Ended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Professor Elmer D. Read has supplied me with the
foregoing two examples done into the Sign Language of
the deaf, as below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I—came—here—to-day—make—agreement (think
parallel)—name (written). My—1 C (100) tents—beyond—B-l-a-c-k
H-i-l-l-s, near Y-e-l-l-o-w-s-t-o-n-e
<!--page-xlvi-->
water flow. You—most—chief, feel—tender—me. I—ragged
sleeve (poor). My—five—children (sign size)—sick—nothing—eat.
Snow—deep. Weather (air,
wind)—very cold. Perhaps—God—look down on (see)
me. I—go. In—one—month—I—shall—arrive—tents—home
(eat, sleep).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The Lord’s Prayer in Deaf Signs:</h4>

<div class="poetry">
    <div class="line">Our—Father—sky—into.</div>
    <div class="line">Honored—thy—name—truly.</div>
    <div class="line">Thy—kingdom—come;</div>
    <div class="line">Thy—law—do—on—earth—as—in—sky.</div>
    <div class="line">Give—us—our—bread—daily.</div>

    <div class="line">But—save (break our tied hands)—us—from—lawbreaking.</div>
    <div class="line">Because—thine—kingdom, power, and—glory—forever.</div>
    <div class="line">Amen.</div>
</div>
<!--page-xlvii-->

<h3>PICTURE-WRITING</h3>

<p>As already noted, a weakness of Sign Language is the
difficulty of writing it without translating it into words,
and thereby changing its nature and its world-wide
application. Yet it can be written; and some mention
of its recorded form may fitly round out this introduction.</p>

<p>The characters used, because they represent ideas, not
words or letters, are called ideographs or picture-writing.
It is widely believed that Sign Language is the oldest of
all languages, that indeed it existed among animals
before man appeared on earth. It is universally accepted
that the ideograph is the oldest of all writing.
The Chinese writing, for instance, is merely picture-writing
done with as few lines as possible.</p>

<p>Thus, it is said that their curious character for <i>Hearing</i>
was once a complete picture of a person listening
behind a screen, but in time it was reduced by hasty
hands to a few scratches; and <i>War</i>, now a few spider
marks, was originally a sketch of <i>Two women in one
house</i>.</p>

<p>We may also record our Sign Language in picture-writing,
as was the custom of many Indian tribes; and
we shall find it worth while for several reasons: it is
picturesque and useful for decoration; and it is likely
that a pictographic inscription dug up 10,000 years from
now would be read, whether our language was understood
or not.<a id="marker-3" class="marker" href="#footnote-3" title="Footnote 3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<!--page-xlviii-->

<p>When the French Government set up the Obelisk of
Luxor, in Paris, and wished to inscribe it for all time,
they made record, not in French or Latin, but in pictographs.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, a good thing to take the young through
the stages of race development; just as the young bird
must run for a send-off, before it flies, so pictography,
being its earliest form, is the natural first step to
writing.</p>

<p>In this dictionary I give the written form after many
of the signs that have an established pictograph. These
are chiefly from Mallery, 10th Annual Report Bureau
of American Ethnology. A few are popularly accepted
among ourselves.</p>
<!--page-xlix-->

<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p>The letters, initials, etc., after the paragraphs indicate
the chief authority for the sign.</p>

<p>Where no authority is given, it means that the sign
was observed by myself among the Cheyenne Indians.
Those ascribed to other Indians also were observed by
myself. Besides these the following are cited:</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Standing for Captain William Philo Clark, U.
S. A.</p>

<p><i>Scott</i>, for General Hugh L. Scott, U. S. A.</p>

<p><i>Seger</i>, for John M. Seger, of Colony, Oklahoma.</p>

<p><i>R. B.</i>, for Robert Burns, the Cheyenne interpreter
at Concho, Oklahoma.</p>

<p><i>Long</i>, for Major Stephen H. Long, U. S. A.</p>

<p><i>Pop.</i> for Popular; that is, established among ourselves.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> for Deaf Sign, as given in J. Schuyler Long’s Dictionary.</p>

<h4>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</h4>

<p>The drawing shows the hands as seen by the second
person.</p>

<p>The digits are named: thumb, first or index finger,
second or middle finger, third or ring-finger, and fourth
or little finger.</p>

<p>The following marks, etc., are used in the illustrations:</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated the <i>solid outline</i> indicates the
position of the hands at the beginning of a sign, the
<i>dotted outlines</i> indicate the position of the hands at the
finish.</p>
<!--page-l-->

<p>................ Dotted lines indicate the course of
hand employed in the sign.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-la.png" class="inline" alt="Greater-than sign &gt;" /> Indicates the commencement point of the movement.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-lb.png" class="inline" alt="Rightwards arrow →" /> Indicates the direction of movement.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-lc.png" class="inline" alt="Latin capital letter X" /> Indicates the point in the gesture line at which the
hand position is (x) changed.</p>

<p><img src="images/page-ld.png" class="inline" alt="Circled dot ⊙" /> Or full stop represents the termination of the movement.</p>

<p>“A hand” means like A, and “B hand” means like
B, etc., in the one-handed Deaf Alphabet (Cut 1) on
next page. The positions meant by “4 hand,” “5
hand,” “flat hand,” “flat fist,” or “compressed hand,”
are figured on the same page.</p>

<p>Begin by learning the Single-hand Manual alphabet
as noted above.</p>

<p>Next learn the <i>Numbers</i> and the signs for <i>Question</i> and
its combinations; also <i>Yes</i> and <i>No</i>, <i>Good</i> and <i>Bad</i>, <i>Come</i>
and <i>Go</i>, <i>Big</i> and <i>Small</i>, <i>Truth</i> and <i>Lie</i>, <i>Strong</i> and <i>Weak</i>,
<i>Understand</i>, <i>Perhaps</i>, <i>Talk</i> and <i>Sign-talk</i>, after this refer
to the Dictionary for the signs that serve your purpose
and use them according to the rules of syntax as herein
set forth.</p>

<p>Never lose a chance of talking the Sign Language with
an old Plains Indian, preferably of the Cheyenne or
Arapahoe tribes. Their wonderful facility and grace
are as hard to convey on paper as the pronunciation of
French, and are as essential for the best style in Sign
Talk. One may, indeed, know every sign in this book
and not be a good sign-talker, so fundamental is this
correct accent, or manner.</p>
